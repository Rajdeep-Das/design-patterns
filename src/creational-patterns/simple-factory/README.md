# Simple Factory

### Category: Creational

One word explaination

> The simple factory generates an object for the client without exposing any of it's instantiation logic

Detailed explaination

> The simple factory is an object that will return "new" objects with varying prototypes as the result of a function / method call.

When do we use it?

> It makes sense to use a factory when there could be additional logic in creating objects, or it's not very DRY to create the object under normal object creation means in the current block of code.
